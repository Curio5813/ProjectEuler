    Amicable numbers

    Let sum(d(n)) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
    (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
    If sum(d(a)) = b and sum(d(b)) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are called
    amicable numbers.

    For example, the proper divisors of 220 are

    1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
    
    The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

    This function return the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10.000.
