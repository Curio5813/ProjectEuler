    Pandigital products

    We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use
    of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit
    number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

    The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
    containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9
    pandigital.

    Thie functions return the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
    identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

    HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
    include it once in your sum.
